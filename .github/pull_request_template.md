This template for pull requests on GitHub enables creating a smooth and efficient way of working with dbt for analytics.

A pull request (PR) is the final check to make sure nothing has been missed and all the business and logic requirements are in place on code or project. 
A template for pull requests also makes it easier and clearer for the reviewer to get an idea and overview of the changes before looking at the actual code and standardizes the whole process for working and reviewing code changes on dbt core.
